# Projectile Simulator

This program allows you to simulate projectile physics with variable initial conditions to see how it behaves. Feel free to play with it.

The purpose of making this projectile motion simulator was to learn a bit about JavaScript's 2D canvas and improve my web designing skills.

See the **[Live demo](https://anic17.github.io/projectile-simulator)**
