# Projectile Simulator

This program allows you to simulate projectile physics with variable initial conditions to see how it behaves. Feel free to play with it.

The purpose of making this projectile motion simulator was to learn a bit about about JavaScript's 2D canvas, and improve my web designing skills.



## Features

 - Path preview
 - Object bouncing & realistic collision physics
 - Five initial conditions that can be altered:
    - Angle
    - Initial speed
    - Gravity
    - Restitution coefficient
    - Initial height
 - Display of information about:
    - Time taken
    - Final velocity
    - Final position
    - Maximum height
